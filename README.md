### NAME
	Cryptogram Helper
### VERSION
	1.0
### DESCRIPTION
	This application allows you to interactively solve a cryptogram puzzle by substituting letters into a message.
### INSTRUCTIONS
	I usually get my puzzles from the Cecil Whig's website: http://www.cecildaily.com/diversions/cryptoquip/

	Enter the crypted message in the yellow message box and click begin to start solving the puzzle.

	Substitute letters by dragging a letter from the grey box of free letters above to the green box above the letter for which you wish to substitute it in the blue message display.
	Alternatively, moving the cursor over the green box above a letter and typing the desired substitution has the same effect.

	Individual substitutions can be cleared by dragging the substituted letter out of its green box.

	To reset all the substitutions at any time, click the reset button under the orange message input box.
	Any typos can be fixed on the fly by simply editing the crypted message in the orange box.

	The red boxes below the message display information about the frequency of each character in the message.

### SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
	This is my first program written in javascript, so there may be some issues running it across different browsers.
	I have had the most success running the site on Chrome but am working on improving the accommodation for different browsers and versions.
